# Societhy
Final Project for the ConsenSys 2018 Developer Program

## A decentralised meetup platform
Societhy provides a way for Ethereum enthusiasts to create a local meetup, without
paying any subscription costs for hosting it. You can create a meetup which is called a society,
and assign it a location, name, and a logo which is stored on IPFS.

As a society owner you can add organisers to help you out, they can't change the society name
or logo but they can create events. An event is run under a society and members of a society can
choose to attend it.
